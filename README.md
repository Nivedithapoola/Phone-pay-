Transaction & User Analysis – Python EDA Case Study

 Project Overview :
This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on transaction
and user registration data across Indian states and districts.
The analysis focuses on understanding transaction trends, data quality,
user adoption, and regional patterns using Python.

The objective is to extract meaningful insights from raw data and
demonstrate practical data analysis and problem-solving skills.


 Business Objectives :
Understand transaction trends over different years
Analyze state-wise and district-wise activity
Identify data quality issues such as missing values
Analyze registered users by device brand
Identify top-performing states and districts
Support data-driven insights for digital adoption analysis



Dataset Description :
The dataset includes information related to:
State-wise transactions
District-wise transactions
Transaction amounts and counts
Registered users
Device brand
Year-wise data

Key columns include:
  State
  District
  Year
  Transaction Amount
  Transaction Count
  Registered Users
  Device Brand



 Tools & Libraries Used :
Python  
Pandas  
NumPy  
Matplotlib / Seaborn  
Jupyter Notebook  



Key Analysis Performed  :
Data Understanding & Cleaning
  Displayed basic statistics and data types
  Identified missing values
  Calculated percentage of missing data
  Observed null values in:
  amount column (state transactions)
  code column (district transactions)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
State-wise transaction trend analysis over years
District-wise analysis for highest activity
Identification of top states and districts
Analysis of device brands with highest registered users
Population-based district comparisons



Key Insights :
  Certain states consistently show higher transaction volumes
  Digital transactions have increased significantly over the years
  A few device brands dominate user registrations
  Missing values are limited and do not heavily impact analysis
  Transaction activity varies significantly across districts



Visualizations :
Line charts for year-wise transaction trends
Bar charts for top states and districts
Device brand comparison charts
 Distribution plots for transaction amounts



Conclusion :
This project demonstrates the ability to perform end-to-end EDA:
from data inspection and cleaning to insight generation and visualization.
It highlights strong skills in Python, data analysis, and analytical
thinking, making it suitable for Data Analyst and Business Analyst roles.
